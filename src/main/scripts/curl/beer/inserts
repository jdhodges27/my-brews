#         , "description": "Ale to the Chief! This original recipe, first customized and brewed by the White House kitchen staff, is now available by popular demand as a Northern Brewer kit. Built on a big foundation of malt with strong tones of biscuit and toffee, the Honey Ale plays up the fruity, caramel aspects of English malt and yeast. But much like the Founding Fathers would have spiced up traditional style ales with homegrown ingredients, a late addition of pure honey adds a revolutionary twist. Declare your independence from mediocre beers with this historic White House Homebrew!"

By starting with a stronger-than-average robust porter, then infusing it with Bourbon-soaked oak (we recommend Maker\u0027s Mark), the end result is quite possibly the best beer ever."

What if you added the honey at the very last possible minute to maximize its presence in the finished beer? What if it was delicious? This recipe is a spinoff of our highly popular Nut Brown Ale kit that combines American malts, hops and ale yeast with honey. A well-balanced and intensely drinkable beer."

Serve in a tall glass \u0022mit hefe\u0022 - swirl the bottle to make sure you get all the yeast!"
